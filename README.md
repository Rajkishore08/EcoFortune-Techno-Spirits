UI/UX Optimization for Eco-Conscious Themes:

The initial design felt cluttered and didn‚Äôt fully capture the clean, nature-based concept.
Solution: We refined the UI by incorporating natural, earthy tones and minimalist design principles.

Integrating Plotch.ai for Investment Insights:

Fine-tuning the Plotch.ai model for personalized investment insights was challenging.
Solution: With help from Ayuh Mital sir, we refined the model and adjusted the data preprocessing to improve its accuracy.
Integrating Avalanche and Wolfram:

Integration of Avalanche and Wolfram caused errors, particularly due to compatibility issues.
Solution: We broke down the process into smaller steps and consulted documentation and online communities to resolve the issues.
Future Enhancements
Expand Investment Data Sources: Integrate additional APIs to provide more comprehensive investment options.
AI-Powered Investment Advisor: Improve the Plotch.ai model to provide even more personalized recommendations.
Mobile Compatibility: Ensure full mobile responsiveness and optimize the UI for smaller screens.
